🧩 Amazon OA2 Strategy Cheat-Sheet (SDE-II)

Think of this as your decision-making framework for every scenario.

1️⃣ Customer Obsession

Always prioritize the highest customer impact first.

Ask yourself:

“Which action protects customers or prevents revenue loss?”

Minor internal bugs come second to production-impacting issues.

2️⃣ Bias for Action

Don’t wait for approval unless absolutely required.

Take the fastest action to mitigate impact, then inform stakeholders.

Amazon loves engineers who move fast and safely.

3️⃣ Ownership

Take responsibility for the entire system, not just your code.

Even if the bug isn’t yours, if you can mitigate, you own the outcome.

Avoid answers like:

“It’s not my problem.”

4️⃣ Dive Deep

Investigate root causes before escalating blindly.

Gather enough facts to make a reasoned, fast decision.

Example: If multiple systems fail, check logs, alerts, dependencies before acting blindly.

5️⃣ Earn Trust / Collaborate

Communicate clearly with teammates and managers.

Even if you take fast action, notify the right people immediately.

Collaborate to resolve conflicts; don’t blame.

6️⃣ Prioritize by Impact, Not Ease

Don’t pick tasks because they’re easier or more comfortable.

Pick the action that reduces risk or customer impact the most.

7️⃣ Escalate Wisely

Only escalate if you cannot mitigate or make progress safely.

If escalation is needed, explain your findings and actions clearly.

8️⃣ Multi-step Mental Checklist for Every Question

What is the customer impact?

Can I take action immediately?

Who needs to be informed?

What is the root cause / context?

Is escalation necessary?

What resolves the problem fastest while owning the outcome?

💡 Quick Amazon OA2 tip

Never pick “wait” unless waiting is safer than acting.

Always act first, communicate second.

Amazon scores decisions, not just technical knowledge.

Think SDE-II level ownership, not just coding correctness.
